# Vim Plugins

This is just a collection of plugins that I use for my vim setup.

## Installation

If you are using version 8+, then just clone the repository into vim's built in package manager directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/.vim/pack
git clone http://github.com/frankiebaffa/vim_plugins ~/.vim/pack
cd ~/.vim/pack
./update.sh
./install.sh
```
